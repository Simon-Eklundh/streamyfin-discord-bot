## TODO

- Add option to `/repo` to list all Repos associated with Streamyfin.
- Revise `/createissue` to integrate options to choose Repository. We need to find a Way to have separate issue forms, because each Repo needs different informations about an issue
~~- Create a command that indicates that a TV version of Streamyfin is already being worked on~~

more to come...
